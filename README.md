# Dog Breed Classification App

The purpose of this app is to have a web app for interacting with a [dog breed classifier](https://github.com/Rendiere/dog-app) that I built.


## Getting Started

### Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rendiere/react-dog-app.git
```

### Start the app

First install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Then start up the app
```bash
npm start
```

### Using the app

To use this app locally, set up the dog breed classifier app found [here](https://github.com/Rendiere/dog-app).

After following the installation instructions, you should have a simple Flask app running at `localhost:8080`. Be sure to open up your browser to localhost port 8080 to verify that the app works - this should load a very simple image upload page.

Then, after starting up this app, head to `localhost:7000` in your browser (this should open up automatically though) to upload an image and get back a prediction of what dog breed is present in the photo.

You can upload any photo - a photo of yourself for example - and get an indication of what dog breed _seems to be_ visible in the photo.
